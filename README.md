# LinkedListProblems

Each week i'll solve one problem related to LinkedLists using Golang programming language.

## Abstract

This repo reviews basic linked list code techniques and then works through 18
linked list problems covering a wide range of difficulty. Most obviously, these problems
are a way to learn about linked lists. More importantly, these problems are a way to
develop my ability with complex pointer algorithms. Even though modern languages
and tools have made linked lists pretty unimportant for day-to-day programming, the
skills for complex pointer algorithms are very important, and linked lists are an excellent
way to develop those skills.
